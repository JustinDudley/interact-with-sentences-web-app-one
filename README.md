This project is part of pair with the following BE project:
interact-with-sentences-mern-mongodb
The backend calls my Atlas Db for cube/embedded_tableaus

I _believe_ I modelled this project after my Thimble project, as far as eslint and other things goes

Regarding CSS modules. This is a quote from the create-react-app documentation:
" This is an optional feature. Regular <link> stylesheets and CSS files are fully supported. CSS Modules are turned on for files ending with the .module.css extension. "
